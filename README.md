# Numeric_Matrix_Processor
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers which can have certain operations performed on them. This matrix processor includes 6 of those operations.

The included 6 operations are:

- Adding 2 Matrices
- Multiplying a matrix by a constant
- Multiplying 2 matrices
- Transposing a matrix
- Finding the determinant of a matrix
- Finding the inverse of a matrix 

Quick tutorial on how to use:

1. When first on screen, type just the number corresponding to your desired operation.
2. Input any matrix size as "m n" which denotes an m x n matrix.
3. Input the matrix one row at a time. e.g. the following matrix.

        1 2 3
        4 5 6
        7 8 9

   should be entered as "1 2 3" then "4 5 6" then "7 8 9".
